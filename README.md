# Who Is My Opponent LoL

# Overview
"Who Is My Opponent LoL" is a helper app that allows players to determine how good a player is by analyzing champions he is most skilled at and how skilled a Summoner is in certain champions. It also helps you in getting quick access to list of champions you can earn mastery chest on.
It allows you to:
1. Get track of Summoner's top 7 champions: mastery level, current score, if mastery chest is earned for this champion.
2. Lookup who are you playing with in current game. Listed info shows: summoner name, currently played champion, main champion, two other champions with highest score. You can also click on any summoner to load his data and see detailed info.
3. Lookup for which champions mastery chest was not earned yet. Note that list displays all champions including those you don't own (due to Riot's policy - you cannot get data of summoner's possessions).
4. Not implemented feature: champion tracking. The idea is that you can select up to three champions and whenever it is present in Summoner game (and gets a good score) - a replay will be saved so that you can re-watch the game and analyze how champion was played. This will also be helpful in analyzing your mistakes with certain champions or getting replays of a pro-player when he plays champion you like.
    The feature is not implemented due to lacking knowledge of how to run a replay file on local computer. If anyone knows this - please share it at "edgeofdestiny@mail.ru" and I'll try to fully implement tracking. As of now - just leave those selections blank (otherwise junk consisting of non existing replays will be generated).

# Updates
Keep "Who Is My Opponent LoL" updated so that new champions, new mastery levels and new features will be up to date and work properly.
There is an embedded mechanism that checks for updates on launch. But if you feel that it doesn't work properly - feel free to download newest version manually.
I strongly recommend downloading "Who Is My Opponent LoL" from original source at github to ensure you're not using modified version with malicious code.
