# Who Is My Opponent LoL

# Application allows you to:
1. Get track of 7 champions with highest score: mastery level, current score, if mastery chest is earned for this champion
2. Lookup who are you playing with in current game. Quick info shows: summoner name, currently played champion, main champion, two other champions with highest score. You can also click on any summoner to load his data and see detailed info.
3. Lookup for which champions mastery chest was not earned yet. Note that list displays all champions including those you don't own (due to Riot's policy - you cannot get data of summoner's posessions).
4. Not implemented feature: champion tracking. The idea was that you can select up to three champions and whenever someone plays this champion (and gets a good score) - a replay will be saved so that you can rewatch the game and analyze how champion was played. The feature is not implemented due to lacking knowledge of how to run a replay file on local computer. If anyone has knowledge of this - please share at "ntu4ka@inbox.ru" and I'll try to fully implement tracking. As of now - just leave those selections blank (otherwise junk comsisting of non existing replays will be generated).
